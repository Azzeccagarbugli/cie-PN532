# cie-PN532
Arduino library for SPI access to the PN532 NFC chip in the Italian Electronic Identity Card (CIE).

## Prerequisites
This library depends upon the **Adafruit_PN532** library which you can obtain from its GitHub Repository.

[https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-PN532](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-PN532)

You must install both the Adafruit_PN532 and cie_PN532 in your Arduino _libraries_ directory.
Plese follow the instructions from the Arduino guide.
